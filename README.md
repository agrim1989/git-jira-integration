# MCP Server Configuration and Deployment Plan

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to configure and deploy an MCP server for project KAN, as outlined in ticket KAN-8.

## Approach Plan
1. **Review Existing Configurations**: Gather and review existing documentation and configurations of similar MCP servers to understand best practices and requirements.
2. **Define Configuration Requirements**: Identify necessary configuration settings such as network, security, and storage for the MCP server.
3. **Develop Deployment Strategy**: Outline the step-by-step deployment process, including backups, testing, and validation.
4. **Plan Testing and Validation**: Develop a testing strategy to ensure the MCP server functions as expected post-deployment.
5. **Assign Resources and Responsibilities**: Identify necessary personnel and resources for the configuration and deployment process.
6. **Create a Rollback Plan**: Develop a plan for rolling back to a previous state in case of deployment issues.

## Solution
To configure and deploy the MCP server for project KAN, as outlined in ticket KAN-8, it's essential to follow a structured approach.

### Step 1: Review Existing Configurations
Gather all relevant documentation and review the configurations of similar servers to understand the requirements and best practices.

### Step 2: Define Configuration Requirements
Identify the necessary network settings, security protocols, and storage allocations for the MCP server. Ensure these settings align with the project's overall architecture and security standards.

### Step 3: Develop Deployment Plan
Develop a detailed deployment plan outlining the step-by-step process for deploying the MCP server, including any necessary backups, testing, and validation procedures.

### Step 4: Plan Testing and Validation
Develop a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the MCP server is functioning as expected after deployment.

### Step 5: Assign Resources and Responsibilities
Assign the necessary resources and responsibilities clearly to ensure the configuration and deployment process runs smoothly.

### Step 6: Create Rollback Plan
Create a plan for rolling back to a previous state in case any issues arise during or after the deployment.
